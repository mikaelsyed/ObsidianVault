</b><br>
The outcrop is about 4 meters tall with compositional banding of black, white and grey. The  banding has 5-10cm of thickness. A majority of the outcrop contains coarse-grained minerals and occasionally mega-crystic quartz crystals (2). The minerals tend to be euhedral and subhedral with garnets being euhedral.
<br>

<b style="color: #458592; font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Schibsted Grotesk', sans-serif;">Mineral Composition:
</b><br>
35% Calcite, 10% Garnet, 40% Pyroxene or Amphibole, 15% Quartz.

<b style="color: #458592; font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Schibsted Grotesk', sans-serif;">Protolith & History:
</b><br>
The protolith is most likely a limestone or other sedimentary rock. Since limestone is mainly composed of calcite, however, dolostone could also be a likely protolith. The result of the mineral composition that we see of garnet, pyroxene, amphibole, and quartz, could also aid in the fact the protolith could be a shale. This is backed up by the fact that there is foliation present in the rock. There is a high probability that varying lithologies in this outcrop have led to this mixture.

This outcrop is dark and weathered and stands 15-18 meters tall. Compositional banding is
present but is faint from the weathered surface. Shearing of micas can be seen near the
bottom of the outcrop all across. Has a medium to coarse-grained mineralogy present throughout the outcrop.

20% Garnet, 5% Biotite, 10% Amphibole, 10% Quartz, 5% Alkali Feldspar, 30% Pyroxene.

<b style="color: #458592; font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Schibsted Grotesk', sans-serif;">Protolith & History:
</b><br>
The presence of garnet, biotite, amphibole, quartz, K-spar, and pyroxene indicates a
complex mineralogy, and the metamorphic rock likely originated from a shale or granitic
protolith.

The mineralogical composition, along with the shearing of micas and compositional
banding, suggests a high-grade metamorphic rock, most likely a gneiss from the
compositional banding. Gneisses often show compositional layering or banding due to the
segregation of different minerals during metamorphism. The specific protolith might have
been a pelitic sedimentary rock (shale) or a felsic igneous rock (granite).

The shearing of micas is the result of ductile deformation, which is common in the higher
grades of metamorphism. The wide range of mineralogy suggests that the original rock had
a varying composition, and the metamorphic process led to the development of these
minerals under high-pressure and temperature conditions. An amphibolite facies are the
likely facies that this rock is due to the mineral composition, as well as the higher
temperature and pressure needed.

The outcrop is approximately 10.8 meters tall and most of the lithology is a black to dark grey colour with pegmatite intrusions. These pegmatite intrusions are approximately 0.65 meters thick. Weak to moderate schistosity of micas are present in the outcrop, along with weak gneissic banding. 

The pegmatites have coarse-grained mineralogy while the darker lithology of the outcrop
has fine-grained mineralogy. Additionally, pegmatites contain (for the most part) euhedral
crystal habit with their mineralogy. The darker lithology contains mostly anhedral crystals.

Pegmatite: 60% Alkali Feldspar, 35% Quartz, 5% Biotite.

Darker Lithology: 35% Quartz, 35% Dark Mineral, 15% Garnet, 15% Biotite

<b style="color: #458592; font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Schibsted Grotesk', sans-serif;">Protolith & History:
</b><br>
The protolith for the darker lithology was most likely a shale protolith, due to the
abundance of micas, and garnets. Additionally, this can be attributed to the wavy and
straight foliation with the outcrop itself. The pegmatite was most likely formed through
molten rock crystallizing through the darker lithology.

About 3 meters tall, has a dark to light grey colour that varies from foliation (quartz, alkali feldspar, Plagioclase). Strong gneissic banding is present throughout the outcrop. There are no sedimentary structures present. The outcrop as well as 0.5cm to 5cm thickness of bands. Veins of quartz are apparent throughout the rock as well. These veins are accompanied by schistosity of biotite and other micas.

Coarse-grained minerals are common in this outcrop with finer-grained dark minerals. Porphyroclastic texture is present with quartz with polygonal amphibole and biotite. Subhedral quartz, garnet, amphibole and biotite are present as well.

</b><br>
![[OastlerCloseUp.png]]

The protolith for the darker lithology was most likely a shale protolith, due to the abundance of micas, and garnets. Additionally, this can be attributed to the wavy and straight foliation with the outcrop itself (possibly a migmatite). The pegmatite was most likely formed through molten rock crystallizing through the darker lithology. Overall, high-grade metamorphism with intense heat and pressure occurred. Most likely an Amphibolite or Granulite facies due to mineral assemblages and the high-grade metamorphism.
