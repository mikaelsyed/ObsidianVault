### Welcome!
Hi, I’m Mikael! Welcome to my website, where I share my personal projects, notes, articles, and more.
I’m currently in my fourth year at the University of Toronto, pursuing a double major in Environmental Science and Geographical Information Systems (GIS).
My projects primarily involve tools like ArcGIS, RStudio, and Python/ArcPy. Right now, I’m working on a research project with the University of Toronto, focusing on analyzing the geology of Erindale Park in Mississauga using GIS data and field methods. I’m passionate about geological and environmental surveying and aim to continue exploring these fields through statistical analysis and three-dimensional mapping techniques.
